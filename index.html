                        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                        <h2>A Professional Self-Assesstment</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-5"> For my final project I have enhanced 3 programs: Category 1: Software Design and Engineering. Category 2: Algorithm and Data Structures. Category 3: Databases.
                            In 10th grade, I had my first experience with coding. It was an intro to computer science. Ever since that first day in class, I got intrigued by how computers work with the help of hardware and software. Fast forward to the last few days of completing my Bachelor's degree in computer science with concentration in software engineering. I cannot be happier with how my journey took twists and turn. I had great professors always willing to teach and help you grow. Looking back now, I am so thankful for all the struggles such as  finding that one semicolon error that took hours to figure out. I have learned and grown a lot in computer architecture, secure coding, software design, reverse engineering, and more. This effort was completed because of my passion for working with computers and technology.
While in the Computer Science Program, I have learned and improved with innumerable skills. I have refined my attention to detail and security mindset as crucial skills to perform as a software engineer and developer. I learned to be organized and cautious in my code development and doing it with the help of flowcharts and pseudocode. Testing is crucial to ensuring a program works and is free of weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
I have adhered to attention to detail related to code reviews, security standards, and best practices. I Think with security always in my mind and not leaving it to the end is a way to gain a zero-trust ethic and approach that improves my coding skills. By combining code reviews and a security mindset, I can have a look for mistakes and vulnerabilities when the code is in development stage. Applying best practices and standards has helps me produce formatted, understood, and maintainable software code and systems. This allows my peers to review my work easily and discover any overlooked mistakes.
I have learned  the importance of the Software Development Lifecycle and how to apply project management strategies working on a large-scale project as part of a team or as an individual. There are many factors that come into play when dealing with a large project such as coordination with peers, team members, leaders, and clients at the foremost importance. 

Hard skills are: computer and technology skills, data analysis, programming, organizational, attention to detail critical thinking, problem solving, collaborations, software development, web development, security mindset, and mobile development.
Soft skills are:  Data visualization, database, reverse engineering.

Through the program, I increased my capacity to learn new skills in a short time. With each term 8 weeks long, I have taken up challenges to learn new concepts and excel with a lot of pressure. I have always brought solutions to problems, exceled hard skills and abilities such as data analysis, software development, and technical writing. These all are demonstrated and exemplified in the artifacts accompanying this ePortfolio. All those skills combined make an excellent software engineer prospect. 
Throughout my time at SNHu, I have learned a lot about other important parts of life such as social sciences and liberal arts. These useful topics were mind-opening and have made a lot of impact on my thinking and the way I see the world.  
In my CS-499 class, I had a recap of all my previous classes from database to software development to algorithms and data structures. Some of my fun classes were software development and algorithms. CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming and CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization were intensive courses with mobile software development and 3-D computer graphics. In these two courses, I demonstrated my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. CS340 Client/Server Development and DAT220 Fundamentals of Data Mining helped me learn about creating and using databases and showed how useful they are in data visualization and data analysis. I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science.
The Computer Science program has helped me grow as a professional, preparing me to build a fulfilling and productive with a solid contribution to a computer science practice. I have developed an ePortfolio that helps me take my place among computer science professionals; this is a significant achievement.

My e-Portfolio is well-founded and innovative techniques that I have learned through this program. I have computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals through the development of functionalities.  All the enhanced artifacts demonstrate my emphasis on applying a security mindset during the development process to anticipate adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
I look forward to tasks where I can learn and grow. I am driven to complete work, no matter how difficult. If I am stuck, I always ask for help from my peers or seniors or mentors, I do not think it is a sign of weakness. I like to participate in a collaborative culture that creates exciting fresh solutions for the built environment that help clients and internal team members deliver the product vision with the highest outcome. As a highly dependable and diligent professional with a powerful sense of organization and an enthusiastic technical learner, I will enjoy entering new technologies and quickly gaining the required skills. I genuinely look to excelling and pushing myself.
